## Overview

This is a solution to the [Easybank landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 
### The challenge
 My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
## Layout

The designs were created to the following widths:

- Mobile: 375px, 620px, 768px
- Desktop: 1440px


### Links
- [GitHub Pages](https://ebunoluwa1.github.io/Easy-LandingPage/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google fonts


### What I learned
 I learned quite a lot of things via this projects, 
  I used sass for this project of which it it is my first time and I really enjoyed the process because it made my work less strenuous.

I also made a hamburger menu for the first time,it took me a while to get the hang of it but I got to understand it and doing this project as helped me to understand the use of z-index and Transform.


### Continued development
This would be
- hamburger menu
- Positioning and layouts
- Spacing
-  Overlaying of Images etc

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css/) - This helped me for the hamburger menu. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](http://www.corelangs.com/css/box/ontop.html#:~:text=The%20following%20HTML%2DCSS%20code,left%20of%20the%20first%20image) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Overlaying images. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
